# inqomChallenge

To run the test, open a terminal and run the following command:
npx playwright test tests/loginTest.spec.js

Notes:
You'll find my test file under:
tests\loginTest.spec.js

From line 30-36 is a commented section. I usually tend to wait for an API response instead of waiting for an element to be visible.
It was not required in the test so I commented it.
